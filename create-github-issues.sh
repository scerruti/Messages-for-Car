    --label "epic,enhancement,copilot-agent,high-priority" \
    --body "Replace the current WebView-based implementation with a native Jetpack Compose UI that provides better reliability, performance, and automotive compliance.

## Epic Goals
- Eliminate WebView QR code rendering issues
- Improve performance and memory usage
- Better automotive safety compliance
- Native Android integration capabilities

## Child Issues
- [ ] Design and implement data models for messages
- [ ] Create Room database for local message storage
- [ ] Implement background message synchronization service
- [ ] Build native QR code pairing screen
- [ ] Create conversation list UI in Compose
- [ ] Implement message detail/reply UI
- [ ] Add voice message recording/playback
- [ ] Integrate with notification system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QR code pairing works reliably
- [ ] Message sync works in background
- [ ] UI follows automotive design guidelines
- [ ] Performance is better than WebView version
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

@github-copilot This epic will be broken down into smaller issues for implementation."
